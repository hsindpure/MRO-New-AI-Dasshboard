High-Level Architecture Patterns
Frontend Architecture Pattern
Component-Based Architecture (React)
├── Presentation Layer
│   ├── LandingPage.js (Marketing/Entry)
│   ├── FileUpload.js (File Handling)
│   └── Dashboard.js (Main Interface)
├── Service Layer
│   ├── api.js (HTTP Communication)
│   └── helpers.js (Utility Functions)
├── Component Layer
│   ├── ChartContainer.js (Visualization)
│   ├── FilterSidebar.js (Data Filtering)
│   └── CustomizeSidebar.js (Chart Customization)
└── State Management
    ├── useState (Local State)
    ├── useEffect (Side Effects)
    └── useCallback/useMemo (Performance)

Design Pattern: Container/Presentational Components
State Flow: Unidirectional data flow (top-down)
Communication: Props drilling and callback functions
Backend Architecture Pattern
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
├── API Layer (Express Routes)
│   ├── upload.js (File Upload Endpoints)
│   ├── dashboard.js (Dashboard Generation)
│   └── filters.js (Data Filtering)
├── Service Layer
│   ├── dataProcessor.js (File Processing)
│   ├── aiService.js (AI Integration)
│   └── calculator.js (Data Calculations)
├── Middleware Layer
│   ├── upload.js (File Handling)

│   └── session.js (State Management)
└── Data Layer
    ├── sessions Map (In-Memory Storage)
    ├── Temporary Files (/uploads)
    └── Cache Management

Design Pattern: Layered Architecture with Dependency Injection
Data Flow: Request → Middleware → Service → Response

Performance Architecture Decisions
Memory Management Strategy
Frontend Memory Optimization:
├── React.memo for component memoization
├── useCallback for function optimization
├── useMemo for expensive calculations
├── Lazy loading for large components
└── Debounced user inputs (300ms)

Backend Memory Optimization:
├── Streaming parsers for large files
├── Sample-based schema generation
├── Data chunking strategies
├── Automatic session cleanup
└── Cache size limitations
Scalability Considerations
Current Architecture (Single Server):
├── In-memory session storage
├── File system temporary storage
├── Single-threaded processing
└── Vertical scaling only

Prepared Scaling Solutions:
├── Redis for distributed sessions
├── File storage abstraction
├── Microservice-ready structure
└── Horizontal scaling capability
Security Architecture
Data Security:
├── No permanent file storage
├── Immediate file deletion
├── Session isolation
├── Memory-only processing
└── 24-hour data expiration

API Security:
├── CORS configuration
├── Request size limiting
├── File type validation
├── Session management
└── Error information filtering
This architecture demonstrates a well-planned separation of concerns, with each library chosen for specific capabilities that align with the platform's requirements for performance, user experience, and maintainability.
